//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]
        wordB = words[1]
    }
    
//: The question marks after word[0] and word[1] are not necessary. The values of the array are already defined as being optional. Additionally, wordA and wordB are defined as being implicitly unwrapped, so if the goal was to unwrap them (it should be a ! not a ?), that is also unnecessary.


  
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        var numElements = words.count
      
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
    
//: You cannot modify a variable declared with let. You should use var instead. We should return either true or false, we should not be returning nil.
    
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    class func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool? {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        var lenA = wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = wordB.characters.count
      
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        var arrA = Array(wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
}

//: At the end we should return true, not nil. Additionally, the dictionary needs to be initialized, so you need to change the : to = and add parentheses at the end of it.


//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
